This overlay contains only packages migrated to generation 2 (java-*-2 eclass
using ebuilds).

java-experimental-overlay should now contain only generation 1 ebuilds

Packages migrated to generation 2 are moved to this overlay and deleted
from the java-experimental one. Once this is done for all packages, this
overlay will be renamed back to java-experimental.
