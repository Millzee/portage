  25 Feb 2007; Miroslav Å ulc <fordfrog@gentoo.org> +svnkit-1.1.1.ebuild,
  +files/svnkit-1.1.1-build.xml.patch, +metadata.xml:
  New ebuild. Used copy from chewi-overlay. Not sure I did it well because it
  uses some stuff from svn-javahl.jar so a review from someone who understands
  it better would be welcome.
