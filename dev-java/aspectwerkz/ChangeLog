  04 Aug 2007; Miroslav Šulc <fordfrog@gentoo.org> aspectwerkz-2.0.ebuild:
  Dropped restriction on qdox version as qdox has changed versioning scheme
  and it otherwise wouldn't be possible to upgrade to new versions of qdox.

  03 Apr 2007; Miroslav Šulc <fordfrog@gentoo.org> aspectwerkz-2.0.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  Corrected ebuild so it does not force generation-1 ebuild of qdox
