		Unit testing software always requires a testing framework.
		Based on his Smalltalk experiences, Kent Beck developed JUnit
		together with Erich Gamma. Nowadays it is one of the standard
		frameworks with a lot of extension modules. JUnitX is one of
		those modules, allowing to test private and protected Java
		classes, methods and variables.
