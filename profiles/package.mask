# Masked so I can experiement with building testng with both the 1.4 and 1.5
# versions of jars
=dev-java/testng-5.2-r1

#Alistair Bush alistair.bush@gmail.com (11 Mar 2007)
# Masked as does not build.  Currently attempting to seperate
# gluegen from jogl.  It is going moderately successfully.  This shouldn't
# be masked for very long
=dev-java/jogl-1.0.0-r1

#William L. Thomson Jr. wltjr@gentoo.org (8 Mar 2007)
# Masked due to package being incomplete and broken. Not
# all deps are packaged, last on run into seems to be a
# jar from Jetty which is out of date and lacks maintainer
dev-java/htmlunit

#Alistair Bush alistair.bush@gmail.com (10 Feburary 2007)
# Masked so that dev-db/octopus and dev-java/saxon can be updated
# to depend on <fop-0.93.  This is required as fop
# underwent a major redesign and breaks API.

# just backported stuff and began working on it, don't work yet

# kiorky kiorky@cryptelium.net
# This stuff is old and unusable, use jboss-bin in the mean-time
# Only masking >=4.0 so it doesn't effect the official tree.
