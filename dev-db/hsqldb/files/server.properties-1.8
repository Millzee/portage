# Hsqldb Server cfg file.
# See the "UNIX Quick Start" and the "Advanced Topics" chapters
# of the Hsqldb User Guide.

# Warning #1
# In Server mode the server.dbname.X is also required - it can be
# empty, but (since the hsqldb-1.8.0) the line must be present.
# Otherwise you may have problems with starting the server.
# Warning #2
# When running hsqldb in Server mode, for each additional database
# the server.urlid.X entry must have a proper corresponding urlid
# section in the 'sqltool.rc' file.
# Otherwise you may have problems with shutting down the server.
#
# Note that each server can serve only up to 10 different
# databases simultaneously (with consecutive {0-9} suffixes).


# Default database
# - files will be created in /var/lib/hsqldb/localhost/localhost.*
# - url: "jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/"  (note the trailing slash!)
server.database.0=file:localhost/localhost
server.dbname.0=
server.urlid.0=localhost


# Global server settings, commented out with default values.

# host
#server.address=localhost
# IP (alternative)
#server.address=127.0.0.1

# ports for hsql/hsqls protocols (hsqls uses TLS/SSL)
#server.port=9001/544

# Display progress and SQL queries (typically in /var/log/hsqldb.log)
#server.silent=true

# Display JDBC trace messages (typically in /var/log/hsqldb.log)
#server.trace=false

# Use TLS/SSL (secure) sockets
#server.tls=false

# Do not issue System.exit() when the database is closed

# Can open databases remotely

# Database definitions
# ====================
#
# server.database.N=file:[/path/][dir/]prefix
#   (required) Specifies storage method and location of database files.
#
#   .N     - number of database, {0-9}
#   file:  - storage method (mem: is also available, see docs)
#   /path/ - (optional) server home directory, default value specified
#            by SERVER_HOME in /etc/conf.d/hsqldb, typically:
#            /var/lib/hsqldb
#   dir/   - (optional) subdirectory of SERVER_HOME, where all files
#            of the database will reside
#   prefix - base name of the database files created by the server,
#            used with extensions like: <prefix>.properties,
#            <prefix>.script, <prefix>.log, <prefix>.lck, etc.
#  
# server.dbname.N=alias
#   (required since hsqldb-1.8.0) Specifies name of database.
#
#   .N     - number of database, {0-9}
#   alias  - name of the database used when connecting to the server
#
#            exactly one alias can be empty - in this case it defines
#            a default database, the one accessible via url:
#            "jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/"
#            (note the new-style trailing slash)
#
#            aliases have to be specified when connecting via url, ex:
#            "jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/xdb"
#
# server.urlid.N=urlid
#   (required) Specifies section in 'sqltool.rc' describing this database.
#
#   .N     - number of database, {0-9}
#   urlid  - name of the section in 'sqltool.rc'
#
#            it is best to keep the same strings in "server.dbname.N" and
#            "server.urlid.N" for consistency and easier reference


# An example of additional database, using a short path
# - files will be created in /var/lib/hsqldb/xdb/xdb.*
# - url: "jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/xdb"
#server.database.1=file:xdb/xdb
#server.dbname.1=xdb
#server.urlid.1=xdb

# An example of additional database, using a full path,
# a specific dir, and a specific prefix for database files
# - files will be created in /var/lib/hsqldb/db2/newdb.*
# - url: "jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/mydb"
#server.database.2=file:/var/lib/hsqldb/db2/newdb
#server.dbname.2=mydb
#server.urlid.2=mydb
